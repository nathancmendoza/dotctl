# Artifacts

## Expectations

This project must produce a software artifact that meets the following criteria

- Deployment Environment: the expected environment is end-user machines, but can also fit into scripts and other automation tools
- Ease of Distribution: the artifact should be able to function on the appropriate OS as-is; external dependencies should be minimal
- Platform Independence: since `dotter` supports dotfiles on any system, it should also work on multiple platforms
